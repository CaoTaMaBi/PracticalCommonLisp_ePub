Common List Book in ePub Format
===============================

This is an unofficial ePub version of the Practical Common Lisp book
[available online](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/). The HTML of the
website has been downloaded adapted to be processed with Calibre into an
ePub file, which can be read with [iBooks on the
iPad](http://www.apple.com/ipad/features/ibooks.html).

Build
-----

To build the ePub just run `make` at the command line. The `Makefile`
depends on [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) to create the
file.

Download
--------

The source code of the book can be downloaded in
[tar.gz](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/practicals-1.0.3.tar.gz) and
[zip](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/practicals-1.0.3.zip) formats from
the original website.
